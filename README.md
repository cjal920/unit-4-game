CRYSTAL COLLECTOR!

The fun of creating this number-based game for me was the ease with which I found I could add/change html elements and css attributes through jQuery. For version 2.0, I would like to get my crystal images to transform in some way when the user clicks on them. Is it possible to pseudo-class images? Stay tuned!
